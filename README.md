<h1> Polis - a game of strategy and maneuver </h1>

**Polis** came about while I was working on a steampunk novel. In-world the characters were playing a strategy board game called *polis*, based on the Ancient Greek game of the same name. 
Going down an obsessive rabbit hole, I paused writing for a few days to build out a comprehensive ruleset for the game, playtest it, and iterate. I present to you the web application version
of the board game *polis* as seen in the as-yet-unfinished novel *Gears of Crete*.

Start by checking out the <a href="https://github.com/QuinnTheobald/polis-game/blob/master/polis_rules.pdf" target="_blank">ruleset pdf</a>.

Then <a href="https://quinntheobald.github.io/polis-game/" target="_blank">click here to play</a>.

The rules of polis were designed and tested by me, Quinn Theobald. The application code was written by me with the help of Claude Code. Special thanks to my dad for helping me playtest for hours using small chips on a chessboard. The game is inspired by the ancient Greek board game *polis*, of which no ruleset has survived.
