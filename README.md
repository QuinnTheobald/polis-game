**Polis** came about while I was working on a steampunk novel. In-world the characters were playing a strategy board game called *polis*, based on the Ancient Greek game of the same name. 
Going down an obsessive rabbit hole, I paused writing for a few days to build out a comprehensive ruleset for the game, playtest it, and iterate. I present to you the web application version
of the board game *polis* as seen in the as-yet-unfinished novel *Gears of Crete*.
